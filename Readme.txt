How to run
java -jar PrintCheque.jar dollar_input

Why did you approach the exercise the way you did?
I thought of two approaches, one by using division and modulos,
and other of taking three digit substring of number and processing it.

I found substring version more efficient because in division method,
i would have done modulo and division on 10000's, 100's and 10's and
it would have gone more number of operations.

If you had more time, what might you do differently?
I've roughly spend an hours on it.
1. Exploring StringBuilder to reduce string manipulation, if there is some time and space benefit for it.
2. Explore Division and Modulo method as well.
